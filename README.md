# Day 1
Our first day of college was spent visiting Gurudwara shaib. We enjoyed Kirtan there. We felt sleepy after some time. After that we came out of Gurudwara shaib. After coming out we were given tea, bread pakoda, gulab jamun, water and cold drink for refreshment. At 11 o'clock we went inside the auditorium where the principal, teachers and staff of the college welcomed us with great enthusiasm. They guided us for the future and told us about the helps of discipline and financial support.
# Day 2
On day 2 we were most excited to go to college as it was a whole new day for us. First we were told about the foundation which was being organised by Dr. Priya Darshini Ma'am. She told us a lot about human needs, relationships and correct understanding. We got to learn a lot from her.2 Before the beginning of the lecture we were told about the benefits of true scholarship and needy children were asked to take the scholarship.2 Lecture by our Dr. I met Dhingra and he told us about his organisation STEP and TAC. They gave detailed information about engineering skills and events. After the break, our English and maths proficiencies were tested, some questions were solved by us and some were left without preparation.
