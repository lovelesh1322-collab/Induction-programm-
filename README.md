# Day 1
Our first day of college was spent visiting Gurudwara shaib. We enjoyed Kirtan there. We felt sleepy after some time. After that we came out of Gurudwara shaib. After coming out we were given tea, bread pakoda, gulab jamun, water and cold drink for refreshment. At 11 o'clock we went inside the auditorium where the principal, teachers and staff of the college welcomed us with great enthusiasm. They guided us for the future and told us about the helps of discipline and financial support.

day 3 First of all we met the custom club of our college. They told us about their club's events, fests and department wise clubs. They showed their college's events and fest real on their social handle and asked us to join their custom club. And asked us to join the college's NCC and NSS group. 2nd lecture Ours again had a lecture on human universal value which was being taken by Dr. Priya Darshini Maam. She again gave detailed information about human fulfilled needs. But due to too much time taking, the lecture started seeming boring to the students. The students were disrespecting Maam by clapping repeatedly. Maan was showing a lot of anger to the students. Harmara Gautam sir was taking 3 lectures, his topic was on motorsports, he gave a lot of information about car engines. After the break our P2P session started. He gave us coding and other life engineering tips.
