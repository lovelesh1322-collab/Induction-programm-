# Day 1
Our first day of college was spent visiting Gurudwara shaib. We enjoyed Kirtan there. We felt sleepy after some time. After that we came out of Gurudwara shaib. After coming out we were given tea, bread pakoda, gulab jamun, water and cold drink for refreshment. At 11 o'clock we went inside the auditorium where the principal, teachers and staff of the college welcomed us with great enthusiasm. They guided us for the future and told us about the helps of discipline and financial support.
